//Reverse a double linked list
//difference between single and double linked list reverse is that..in single we take 3 pointer variable but in this case reverse is possible with only two pointer

Node* reverseDLL(Node * head)
{
    //Your code here
    Node *current=head;
    Node *prev=NULL;
    Node *temp=NULL;
    while(current!=NULL){
        prev=current->prev;
        current->prev=current->next;
        current->next=prev;
        temp=current;
        current=current->prev;
    }
    return temp;
